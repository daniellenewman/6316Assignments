    "\"Tonight, more than 130,000 Californians will go to sleep homeless. Thatâ€™s enough to fill Dodger Stadium, AT&T Park and Petco Park. The biggest culprit is rising housing costs. From 2000 to 2014, median rent in California increased by more than one-third, while real incomes for renters fell by 7 percent. Today, 1.5 million Californians spend more than half their income on housing. This crisis threatens not just low-income families but our entire economy, driving businesses to relocate to states in which their employees can afford to live. - **Business Insider, Sep 2018.**\"\n",

    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will attempt to cluster the California Housing by implementing and analyzing the k-means algorithm to the data. K-Means is one of the most popular clustering algorithms. K-means stores k-centroids that it uses to define clusters. A point is considered to be in a particular cluster if it is closer to that cluster's centroid than any other centroid. For references, you may refer to my lecture 9 or Chapter 2 of the textbook if you need additional sample codes to help with your assignment. For deliverables, you must write code in Python and submit this Jupyter Notebook file (.ipynb) to earn a total of 100 pts. You will gain points depending on how you perform in the following sections.\n"

    "You must implement your own version of K-Means Algorithm. Input a cluster count K and M data points each with its own vector of N features, along with the choice of a distance measure; then:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialize K centroids. In our case, a centroid is just the average of all data in a cluster, and it can be represented just like a normal cluster.\n",
    "2. Assign each data point to the cluster that has the closest centroid base on a **distance measure**.\n",
    "3. After all data points have been assigned to clusters, recalculate the centroids for each cluster (as averages of all points in the cluster).\n",
    "4. Repeat the data assignments and centroid calculations until no change in gene assignment occurs between iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Distance Measures:** Your implementation must have an option of using two distance measures for clustering: \n",
    "- Euclidean distance: Euclidean distance measures differences in the absolute levels of instances.\n",
    "$d(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y}) = \\sqrt[\\leftroot{2}\\uproot{2}2]{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n|x_i - y_i|^2}$\n",
    "- Spearson rank correlation: Spearson rank correlation uses ranks in place of absolute values, which makes it less sensitive to outliers (extremely high or low values) in the data.\n",
    "$d(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y}) = \\frac{\\sum_i (x^{(i)} - \\bar{x})(y^{(i)} - \\bar{y})}{\\sqrt{\\sum_i (x^{(i)} - \\bar{x})^2 \\sum_i (y^{(i)} - \\bar{y})^2}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementation Notes:** Note that these functions should return distance measures; that is, the returned value should be high if the two vectors are dissimilar, low if they are similar, and zero if they are completely identical. This requirement is already met for Euclidean distance, but Spearson rank correlation varies between -1 and 1, and high values indicate similarity. Therefore, you must transform the Spearson rank correlation so that the returned value is always greater than or equal to zero, with high values indicating dissimilarity."

You should get a plot that looks roughly in the shape of California (see Chapter 2 for more details). Using the cluster means and std. deviations as representative values in the cluster, what can you say about the clusters that were found? How do they compare with what you know about cities and areas in California? What can you attribute the gaps to? It will definitely be helpful to have a map of California handy.\n",

Identify the k with the highest validation accuracy, and report the test accuracy with this choice of k.

Then, plot the data points with different markers corresponding to different classes. Repeat this process for all k and discuss the smoothness of the decision boundaries as k increases.\n"

Hopefully it gives you some intuition as for how the preset number of clusters affects the clustering results. Too few clusters may not reveal the information that is in the data. Too many clusters may hurt data analysis as well, as it may not generalize (and in this sense, it is equivalent to over fitting).
